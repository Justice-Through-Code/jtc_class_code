    "\n",
    "Lists can be stored as **values** inside dictionaries, and referenced using **keys** just as with ever piece of data in a dictionary. \n",

    "For example, we could have a shopping cart with lists for different categories of foods:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cart = {'fruits': ['mangos', 'apples', 'oranges'],\n",
    "        'vegetables': ['spinach', 'peas'],\n",

    "```python\n",
    "restaurants = {'El Basurero': {'address': '32-17 Steinway St, Queens, NY 11103',\n",

    "So, we have an outer-level dictionary here called `restaurants`, which has dictionaries for individual restaurants inside of it. The **keys referrring to each restaurant dictionary are the names of that restaurant**. Each restaurant name key refers to a dictionary with the address and link to the menu of that restaurant. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, if we wanted to add one more restaurant to this dictionary of restaurants, we could do something like this:\n",

    "restaurants['Joes Pizza'] = {'address': '7 Carmine St, New York, NY 10014',\n",
    "                             'phone': '212-366-1182'}\n",
    "print(restaurants)\n",

    "Notice, the key-value pairs in this dictionary can be different from the inside dictionaries for other restaurants here. For 'Joes Pizza', we have `phone`, but no `menu_url` like with the other restaurants. If we print our `restaurants`, we can see that this has been added:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "{'El Basurero': {'address': '32-17 Steinway St, Queens, NY 11103', 'menu_url': 'https://www.allmenus.com/ny/astoria/366154-el-basurero/menu/'}, 'SriPraPhai': {'address': '64-13 39th Ave, Woodside, NY 11377', 'menu_url': 'https://sripraphai.com/menu.html'}, 'Joes Pizza': {'address': '7 Carmine St, New York, NY 10014', 'phone': '212-366-1182'}}\n",

    "# 3. Dictionaries inside lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay! We've seen how to nest things inside of dictionaries, so now we'll see how to nest data in lists. First up, we can put multiple dictionaries in a list. Here, each dictionary is an item in a list. At the most basic level, here is a list made of empty dictionaries.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, maybe not the most helpful, but you can see that it is perfectly acceptable to put dictionaries as list items. Let's see this in action when we make a list of dictionaries containing user accounts for a website:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "users = [{'username': 'ash', 'password': 'ilovepython', 'last_login': '9/28/2020'},\n",
    "         {'username': 'aryn', 'password': 'ilovedictionaries'},\n",

    "\n",
    "### Acccesing items in dictionaries inside a list\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Getting a whole dictionary\n",
    "If we want to pull out a dictionary from a list of dictionaries, we would use **numeric indexing** to get the list item of the correct index. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# to print out the dictionary where `username` is 'yusuf'\n",
    "print(users[2])\n",
    "```\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because the third item in `users` was a dictionary -- that's why we see all this information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding another dictionary to the list\n",
    "\n",
    "We can add more dictionaries to this list using the `append()` command -- we can put the whole dictionary inside the append command\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "users.append({'username': 'aeshna', 'password': 'ilovesublimetxt'})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have:\n",
    "```console\n",
    "[{'username': 'ash', 'password': 'ilovepython', 'last_login': '9/28/2020'}, {'username': 'aryn', 'password': 'ilovedictionaries'}, {'username': 'yusuf', 'password': 'ilovejavascript', 'last_login': '9/26/2020'}, {'username': 'paul', 'password': 'ilovegit'}, {'username': 'aeshna', 'password': 'ilovesublimetxt'}]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Accessing key-value pairs from a dictionary inside a list\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want a specific key-value pair from a dictionary inside a list, however, we can **reference the key inside that dictionary**:\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if we want the `'username'` associated with the second item in `users`, we can do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(users[2]['username'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "yusuf\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "# print users[2] to check the changes\n",
    "print(users[2])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, the only difference between adding vs. updating a key-value pair is whether anything existed with that same key before we assign it. We can use the `.pop()` method again to remove a key-value pair (by referencing the key) from the dictionary. \n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "{'username': 'yusuf', 'password': 'iloveprogramming', 'verified_account': True}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Looping through a list of dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "This part is pretty cool. This is a BIG advantage for putting items in a list -- they are in order now, unlike a dictionary, so we can loop through them. Because we have a list full of users, we can **loop** through each user:\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can print each user out one by one (this is printing each dictionary in the list out one by one):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for user in users:\n",
    "    print(user)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we get each dictionary on a separate line, because the variable `user` here stands for one of the dictionaries on each iteration of the loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "{'username': 'ash', 'password': 'ilovepython', 'last_login': '9/28/2020'}\n",
    "{'username': 'aryn', 'password': 'ilovedictionaries'}\n",
    "{'username': 'yusuf', 'password': 'iloveprogramming', 'verified_account': True}\n",
    "{'username': 'paul', 'password': 'ilovegit'}\n",
    "{'username': 'aeshna', 'password': 'ilovesublimetxt'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Accessing data within each dictionary in a loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Even more than this, we can loop through the dictionaries and access a **specific key-value pair** from each one, as long as each dictionary has data for the corresponding key. So, let's say we wanted to loop through our `users` list and pull out *just the usernames*:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for user in users:\n",
    "    print(user['username'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So here in the loop, `user['username']` indicates that we want the **value** stored at the **key** `username` for **each dictionary** as we iterate through them. This prints out:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "ash\n",
    "aryn\n",
    "yusuf\n",
    "paul\n",
    "aeshna\n",
    "```\n",

    "```python\n",
    "for user in users:\n",
    "    user['username'] = user['username'].upper()\n",
    "    print(user)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So we're reassigning each username to be uppercase\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "{'username': 'ASH', 'password': 'ilovepython', 'last_login': '9/28/2020'}\n",
    "{'username': 'ARYN', 'password': 'ilovedictionaries'}\n",
    "{'username': 'YUSUF', 'password': 'iloveprogramming', 'verified_account': True}\n",
    "{'username': 'PAUL', 'password': 'ilovegit'}\n",
    "{'username': 'AESHNA', 'password': 'ilovesublimetxt'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### If not all dictionaries have the same keys\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's way we were trying to access the `last_login` of each user. It turns out only the first user (ASH) has this information now, so let's see what happens if we try to print this out for everyone:\n",

    "### Nested loops with nested lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we can loop through any list, we can set up **nested loops** to iterate through *each item in each inner list*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for food_group in shopping_list:\n",
    "    for food in food_group:\n",
    "        print(f'I plan to buy some {food}')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in the outer loop we loop through lists, and the `food_group` variable stands for one of the inner lists each iteration. Then, in the inner list, the `food` variable stands for each item (strings) in `food_group`. This gets repeated for each value of `food_group`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "I plan to buy some mangos\n",
    "I plan to buy some apples\n",
    "I plan to buy some oranges\n",
    "I plan to buy some grapes\n",
    "I plan to buy some baby carrots\n",
    "I plan to buy some lettuce\n",
    "I plan to buy some corn flakes\n",
    "I plan to buy some oatmeal\n",
    "I plan to buy some eggs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding a counter\n",
    "\n",
    "Great! So we can see all of the foods across all the nested lists. Now, maybe we want to add a counter to see how many different items we are buying total, or to number our items. Here's one way to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "counter = 1\n",
    "for food_group in shopping_list:\n",
    "    for food in food_group:\n",
    "        print(f'Item #{counter}: {food}')\n",
    "        # this line means to add 1 to the counter variable\n",
    "        counter+=1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We've used a nice operation here, the `+=` symbol. What this does is adds 1 here to counter.\n",
    "* `+1` with any number would add that number to the varible at hand\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So as a result we get: \n",
    "```\n",
    "Item #1: mangos\n",
    "Item #2: apples\n",
    "Item #3: oranges\n",
    "Item #4: grapes\n",
    "Item #5: baby carrots\n",
    "Item #6: lettuce\n",
    "Item #7: corn flakes\n",
    "Item #8: oatmeal\n",
    "Item #9: eggs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Looping through nested lists + logic\n",
    "\n",
    "We can add logical statements in here too. Let's say we only want to add the foods to our list if they contain the letter 'o'.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "counter = 1\n",
    "for food_group in shopping_list:\n",
    "    for food in food_group:\n",
    "        # Only print and advance the counter if food contains an o\n",
    "        if 'o' in food:\n",
    "            print(f'Item #{counter}: {food}')\n",
    "            # this line means to add 1 to the counter variable\n",
    "            counter+=1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the `if 'o' in food:` piece to test whether the character `o` is in the string `food`. So, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "Item #1: mangos\n",
    "Item #2: oranges\n",
    "Item #3: baby carrots\n",
    "Item #4: corn flakes\n",
    "Item #5: oatmeal\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Great! Just the foods with the letter 'o'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why stop here? Nesting to the *extreme*\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically we could nest things with as many levels as we want. Just as an example, here is some extreme nesting\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "nest_a_lot = [[[1,2,3], ['a', 'b', 'c']], [[TRUE, FALSE, TRUE], [{'name':'paul'}, 2.7, 'apples']]]\n",
    "\n",
    "# loop through the 3 levels of nested lists and print out each individual item!\n",
    "for i in nest_a_lot:\n",
    "    for j in i:\n",
    "        for k in j:\n",
    "            print(k)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, here we go throuth three levels of nested lists (plus one of the lists has dictionaries in it!) and print out the items:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "a\n",
    "b\n",
    "c\n",
    "True\n",
    "False\n",
    "{'name': 'aedan'}\n",
    "{'name': 'yusuf'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Wow! So we can go quite far with nesting....it does get tricky to stay organized the more nesting there is though. \n",
