    "        print('Okay! Keeping your password the same for now')\n",
    "        answered = True\n",

    "Okay! This one is a little tricky, but essentially, we first set the variable `answered` to `False`, and we keep going until this is true. Then, we keep prompting the user for a response until they type either `y` or `n`, then set `answered=True` to exit the loop.\n",

    "### Outer & inner loops\n",
    "\n",
    "When we have nested loops, we call the first loop (the one least indented) the **outer** loop, and the indented loops **inner** loops. This is because **each inner loop finishes before the next outer loop starts**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's check this out:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# outer variable loops through range(3)\n",
    "for outer_var in range(3):\n",
    "    # inner variable loops through range(3)\n",
    "    for inner_var in range(3):\n",
    "        # print values of both variables\n",
    "        print(f'outer is {outer_var}, inner is {inner_var}')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So here, we've created both `outer_var` and `inner_var` as `range(3)`, so each will have indices 0,1,and 2. Let's watch and see how the values change as we go through the nested looping:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "outer is 0, inner is 0\n",
    "outer is 0, inner is 1\n",
    "outer is 0, inner is 2\n",
    "outer is 1, inner is 0\n",
    "outer is 1, inner is 1\n",
    "outer is 1, inner is 2\n",
    "outer is 2, inner is 0\n",
    "outer is 2, inner is 1\n",
    "outer is 2, inner is 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we can see that the **inner loop iterates within each iteration of the outer loop**. In other words, the entire inner loop happens for each iteration of the outer loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indentation is your guide!\n",
    "\n",
    "With nested loops and logic, the indentation syntax in python really starts to be very useful to help us read how the nesting is working! We can see that when code is indented after a logical statement or a loop, it is `nested` within this piece of control flow over your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do make a mistake with indentation, python will tell you! For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(3):\n",
    "print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we've forgotton that the second line (`print(i)`) needs to be indented. So when we run, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "  File \"nested_loop_practice.py\", line 2\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "        ^\n",
    "IndentationError: expected an indented block\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This `IndentationError` points to the line that should have been indented, and tells us it expected an indent. Pretty helpful!\n",
    "\n",
    "### A third layer of nesting\n",
    "\n",
    "Just for fun...this doesn't have to stop at 1 inner loop! Let's see what happens if we have 3 layers. So here, we cal our looping variables `i`, `j`, and `k`, and each has a range of 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(2):\n",
    "    for j in range(2):\n",
    "        for k in range(2):\n",
    "            # print out a list with the values of each variable\n",
    "            print([i, j, k])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So this gives us:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[0, 0, 0]\n",
    "[0, 0, 1]\n",
    "[0, 1, 0]\n",
    "[0, 1, 1]\n",
    "[1, 0, 0]\n",
    "[1, 0, 1]\n",
    "[1, 1, 0]\n",
    "[1, 1, 1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
