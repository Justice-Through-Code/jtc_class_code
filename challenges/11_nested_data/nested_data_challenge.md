# Nested Data

In this challenge, we are providing you with a file - `buy_me_a_laptop_challenge.py`. You will be working on this file to play around with nested lists and dictionaries to buy a laptop.

### Overview of the challenge

In this challenge, you will start out with writing loops to access simple lists and dictionaries related to laptops. Once you get that out of the way, you will tackle nested dictionaries and lists and perform read (access) operations on this nested data as well as add, update and delete operations on this nested data of laptops to eventually buy a new laptop.

To get started, make a folder inside your `jtc_class_code/challenges` called `11_bootcamp_nested_data`, and put `buy_me_a_laptop_challenge.py` in there. You can use `ls` inside the folder to make sure the `buy_me_a_laptop_challenge.py` script is really in there!

### Push to Github once you are done

As the final part of your workflow for this challenge, stage your files (`git add .`), commit (_don't forget a commit message_), and push the `buy_me_a_laptop_challenge.py` script you worked on to your `jtc_class_code` github repository.

* Remember to check your Github repo online at the end to make sure this worked
